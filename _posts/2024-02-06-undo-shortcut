Development is progessing well. Shortcuts such as copy, paste, cut, save and exit have been incorporated into the editor, albeit with some minor bugs in relation to the cursor position. Regarding shortcuts, we plan to implement undo, which would mean that all major shortcuts can be used within the editor. There seems to be a number of tutorials for developing undo/redo functionality such as https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implement-undo-and-redo-features-of-a-text-editor/ and https://www.mattduck.com/undo-redo-text-editors.html. We hope that these can inspire us to create our own solution. Once we have implemented this, focus can then be placed on ironing out bugs in areas such as syntax highlighting and cursor position.
