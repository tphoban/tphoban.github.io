As part of our research, we have found some useful resources which could be of use for both implementing and better understanding text editors in general.

The Craft of Text Editing is a book which takes you through the process of developing a text editor. Admittedly, the book uses C as the language of teaching, but since C and C++ share many similarities we can still take inspiration and gain a deeper understanding of text editors.

We have also found some external libraries/tools that we plan to incorporate into our project. All relevant references will be included in our functional specification.
