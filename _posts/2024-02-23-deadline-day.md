We've managed to implement all of our features in time. Linting mode has been added, as well as custom bindings which can be changed by the user! We created a class called `Linter`, which uses Ruff for doing a static code analysis of the file. We've also noted in the documents that linting mode only works with Python files. We have achieved all of our major goals for TTENS and are very satisfied with the final outcome.
