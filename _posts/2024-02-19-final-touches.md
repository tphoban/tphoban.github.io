Since the last blog entry, we have done what we set out to do. Known issues have been handled such as linewise/text selection display issues, cursor movement after pasting and copying special characters such as '\n'. We have even written a script which compiles the TTENS executable and adds a symbolic link to the bin folder, meaning that TTENS is part of the PATH and can be run from any directory on the system. This makes running the program intuitive and follows the convention of editors such as nano, vim, etc. Linting mode has not yet been implemented, however. We plan to have the user manual, technical specifications and linting mode done by the 21st so that we can ensure that no significant bugs have been introduced and give ourselves time for recording the video walkthrough of using TTENS. If linting mode can not be implemented by the 21st, we may have to consider leaving it out.
