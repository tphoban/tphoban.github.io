Today we submitted our proposal for the TTENS project. TTENS is a terminal text editor which is tailored towards novice programmers. It acts as a user-friendly alternative to terminal-based editors such as "Nano" and "Vim". The acronym is short for Terminal Text Editor for Novice Programmers.

The project is planned to be developed in a Linux environment, with C++ as the primary language.
