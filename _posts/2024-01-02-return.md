After a challenging semester and having rested during the winter break, we are motivated and ready to commence project work again. Today we put focus on uploading the blog to our git repo. One of the team members had already written some entries but forgotten to upload it from their local desktop.

In the coming days we plan to devlop the core functionality of the project, namely creating, editing, saving and deleting text files. Once the editor has a strong base, we can then begin working on the shortcut implementation, which is one of our main objectives.
